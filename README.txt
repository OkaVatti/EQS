    | Howdy-Hey, thank you for using Easy Quake Selector.           |
    | Easy Quake Selector is a little script I created              |
    | for use with Quake 1 and Quake 2.                             |
    |                                                               |
    | Easy Quake Selector is a script created for use with Quake 1  |
    | and Quake 2 on UNIX-like operating systems.                   |
    |                                                               |
    | This script allows you to select which Quake game you want to |
    | play and which mod you want to use, and then launches the     |
    | selected client with the appropriate parameters.              |
    |                                                               |
    | Some of the tested Clients and Source ports that work with    |

    | When running the script, you will be asked which game you     |
    | want to play. After selecting a game, you will be prompted to |
    | enter the location of the game's executable file. You should  |
    | enter the location of the file itself, not the directory it   |
    | is located in. Finally, you will be asked which mod you want  |
    | to use.                                                       |

    | Before using the script, it is recommended that you read the  |
    | README.txt file located in the same directory as the script.  |
    |                                                               |
    | This script has been tested on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD,         |
    | OpenBSD, and NetBSD. It may work on other UNIX-like systems   |
    | as well.                                                      |

    | If your system is not supported,                              |
    | the script will inform you and exit.                          |
